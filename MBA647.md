# Course Objectives
Managing People in Organizations is a field of study that investigates the impact that individuals, groups, and structure have on behaviour within an organization. Specifically, this course focuses on how to improve productivity, reduce absenteeism and turnover, and increase employee citizenship and job satisfaction. We all hold generalizations about the behaviour of people. Some of our generalizations may provide valid insights into human behaviour, but many are erroneous. Managing People in Organizations uses systematic study to improve predictions of behaviour that would be made from intuition alone. This course will synthesize many organizational behaviour concepts with the application of several human resource management concepts to yield a fuller picture of this challenge. But, because people are different, we need to look at behaviour in organizations in a contingency framework, using situational variables to moderate cause-effect relationships.

Managing People in Organizations offers both challenges and opportunities for managers. It offers specific insights to improve a manager's people skills. In times of rapid, ongoing, and turbulent change - what most managers face today - Managing People in Organizations can help managers cope in a world of pandemics or temporariness and learn ways to stimulate innovation. Finally, it can offer managers guidance in creating an ethically healthy work climate.

This course is designed to give you an understanding of the attitudes and behaviour of individuals and groups in all types of organizations and as to how organizations, simple or complex, are structured and patterned to achieve their goals. Topics to be covered include job motivation, job satisfaction, job stress, employee selection and succession planning, performance management, workforce diversity, work/life balance, multiple intelligences, workplace behaviour, communication, organizational politics, knowledge management, leadership, group dynamics, decision making, conflict, culture, and change.
This course will strive to help you develop a grasp of what has been referred to as the "rationale of the irrational”.

# Evaluation Details

**Participation – Active learning 10%**

Active Learning: Because this course relies heavily on applications and discussions of materials, 10% of your grade
will be determined from active learning activities. Active learning means that you take responsibility both for your
learning and helping others to learn more about the material. Examples include (but are not limited to)
contributing to class discussion, bringing relevant newspaper and magazine articles to the attention of your
classmates and the instructor. These marks are scaled so that what you might consider “average” participation
results in a mark of about C.

Active learning also means listening to what others say and responding accordingly. Active learning is not coming
to class unprepared and ill-equipped to intelligently discuss the topic of the day. Active learning is also not being a
warm body in the classroom whose mind is pre-occupied with other critical issues such as: how to tackle the next
statistics assignment.

Marks for active learning will be allocated in the following manner:

C: for attending class on a regular basis and only occasionally contributing to the learning experience.

B- to B: for showing an active interest in class activities and participating somewhat in classroom discussions; for
regularly making insightful comments which help others to understand the course material; for being a positive
group member; for otherwise enhancing the learning environment as best as you can considering personality traits
that may hinder.

B+ to A-: for consistently enhancing the quality of discussion in a variety of forms and for near-perfect attendance
(excuses such as a family emergency will be considered legitimate reasons for absence, others are less likely to
qualify) and proving to go above and beyond the call of duty in terms of extra contributions to the classroom
experience (creativity will be rewarded).

A to A+: Students in this category provide leadership in the classroom and work towards enhancing the
interpersonal dynamics of the classroom. This does not mean they dominate the setting; rather they act as
facilitators, bringing others into the discussion and bringing relevant materials to the attention of others.

**Mid-term tests 45%**

You will have 3, 1-hour in-class tests throughout the term, each covering 3-4 OB/HR topics.

Mid-term test 1 will consist of 45 multiple choice questions and will cover the material from weeks 1-2-3:
- What Is Managing People in Organizations?
- Perception, Personality and Emotions.
- Stress at Work

Mid-term test 2 will consist of 3-4 short answer questions and will cover the material from weeks 4-5-6:
- Theories of Motivation
- Motivation in Action
- Groups and Teams

Mid-term test 3 will consist of a single essay addressing the material from weeks 7-8:
- Communications
- Conflict and Negotiation
- Leadership

**Group Project 30% & Group Presentation 15%**

You are responsible for finding a “client” organization able and willing to have you help them solve a problem they
are unable to. You will be required to develop a case study* on the selected organization and its current challenge.

The case study should include:
1) A definition or discussion of a problem, its importance, and managerial implications;
2) A selected review of the literature related to the problem;
3) A summary or conclusion which indicates possible solutions to the problem or extensions or research on the problem. This must be an actual case study of an organization willing /able to agree to participate.

A case is a description of an administrative decision or problem that people are trying to solve (or a record of an issue that
has been faced by the people involved), together with the surrounding circumstances, facts, opinions, and prejudices on
which decisions depended. It is usually written from the point of view of the decision-maker. The focus of a case study can
be on a person and her/his impact, incident, or situation. The case presents actual events that have occurred in an
organization, covering a variety of human aspects of management, to demonstrate the complexity of real-life situations. It
tells how the situation developed and how it was handled up to the decision point.
Each team will be allotted 20 minutes to present the case. The presentation is to include a brief description of the
background and context of the problem situation, identify alternate courses of action, evaluate each and finally
present a recommended solution. There will be a 5-minute question period following your presentation. The entire 
process should take about 25 minutes.

Complete instructions for this project can be found on Moodle.

# Project

Solving a real-world Organizational Behaviour – HRM problem
(45%)

## Objetives

At the end of this project, you should know how to:

* use the relevant and appropriate tools and knowledge of the core business disciplines to analyze organizational problems.
* assess the leadership appropriate for a given context to achieve desired goals.
* generate recommendations for managers that are substantiated by scientific theories and data.
* express ideas on your topic of choice, professionally and concisely, orally and in writing.
* work collaboratively in the spirit of good scholarship.

## Overview
Managers of the future will be required to understand OB/HRM concepts related to organizational life and to transfer that knowledge to the unique situations they face. This project is designed to help you apply OB/HRM concepts to real-life situations found in organizations.
You are responsible for finding a “client” organization able and willing to have you help them solve a problem they are unable to. You will be required to develop a case study* on the selected organization and its current challenge. The case study should include: (1) a definition or discussion of a problem, its importance, and managerial implications; (2) a selected review of the literature related to the problem; (3) a summary or conclusion which indicate possible solutions to the problem or extensions or research on the problem. This must be an actual case study of an organization willing /able to agree to participate. The value for the organization is an insightful report from your group helping them.

*A case is a description of an administrative decision or problem that people are trying to solve (or a record of an issue that has been faced by the people involved), together with the surrounding circumstances, facts, opinions, and prejudices on which decisions depended. It is usually written from the point of view of the decision-maker.

In a very general sense, there are four types of cases:

<ol type="a">
  <li>Individual problem</li>
  <li>Isolated incident</li>
  <li>Organizational problems</li>
  <li>A combination of the above three</li>
</ol>

The focus of a case study can be on a person and her/his impact, incident, or situation. The case presents actual events that have occurred in an organization, covering a variety of human aspects of management, to demonstrate the complexity of reallife situations. It tells how the situation developed and how it was handled up to the decision point. The focal point of integrating organizational behaviour and human resources management in this task is critical and doable.

## Requirements

The deliverable for this group assignment will be a report in the form of a case study, and a team presentation of your findings.

1. This submission should be as thorough as possible and should be restricted to literature that you personally have been able to obtain. The review should include materials from the assigned textbook, empirical studies and applied periodical articles. Your paper should follow proper report writing procedures, using APA format and citations. The length of this assignment should be approximately 20-25 pages. The power point presentation needs to be submitted at the same time as the formal report.
The credibility of your recommendations will depend on the reliability, validity, and quality of the information used to generate those recommendations. To facilitate the generation of sound recommendations, this project requires each group to use numerous sources, and it places some constraints on information quality by requiring that a sufficient number of sources are from scientific journals. Specifically:

* There must be a minimum of three (3) documents per member of the team (e.g., a five-member team will be required to find 15 documents) and the list of documents must contain:
  * Two (2) empirical articles per team member. An “empirical” article presents the results of one or more studies in which data were collected and analyzed. If you are not sure that an article is empirical, please ask a reference librarian.
  * One (1) additional document per team member; this can include empirical or theoretical articles from scientific journals, books (academic or business oriented), magazines, newspapers, and so on. All documents should be from printed or electronic media (e.g., no television or movie clips). Please note that a lot of information found on the internet is of questionable reliability and quality (e.g., blogs, advertisements, internal company documents). Be very careful about using such sources to justify recommendations.
The case study report should be double-spaced, with text (Arial or Times New Roman) of 12-point font aligned to the left and 1-inch margins all around. A PDF copy of your case study report is to be submitted using the link on Moodle no later than April 2.
The case study report will be worth 30% of your final grade.

2. Each team will be allotted 20 minutes to present the case. Groups will negotiate amongst themselves as to which order and date teams will present for the final two weeks (tbc). It is an excellent experience in negotiations; however, this process needs to be finalized early in the semester by you and your team. The presentation is to include a brief description of the background and context of the problem situation, identify alternate courses of action, evaluate each and finally present a recommended solution. There will be a 5-minute question period following your presentation. The entire process should take about 25 minutes.
A copy of your PowerPoint presentation is to be submitted using the link on Moodle no later than April 2.
The presentation will be worth 15% of your final grade.

## Evalulation
Group presentations will be marked on a modified BARS basis: That is, each presentation will have several critical elements; each of these elements is behaviourally identified into Above Average, Average, and Below Average categories. The “numbers” in the following descriptions are ONLY for the professor to judge the quality of the project and should not be correlated to any quantitative scale. These categories, their behavioural descriptions and the mark allotment for each category are outlined below.
Content (75 marks): including Problem Definition, Analysis, and Solution, including creation and selection of Alternatives; and,
Presentation (25 marks): including creativity, originality and diversity of presentation methods, verbal, and nonverbal presentation skills, and prompting and leading the group discussion.
► Please be aware that the evaluation of group presentations rests solely with your instructor whose expertise, training and judgement are utilised in the awarding of a grade for each group. The Graduate School only utilizes letter grades, not numeric. This project will also be evaluated by a grade for this final exercise as assigned by the instructor. The evaluation scheme is given to you now and will not change when you present.

<ol type="A">
  <li>CASE STUDY</li>
  
1. PROBLEM DEFINITION
ABOVE AVERAGE Problem is diagnosed (defined) within the framework of a theoretical concept, based on sufficient supporting data and evidence. Data, facts, and assumptions are clearly articulated (that is, there should not be any “How do you know that?” questions remaining.). In essence, this is a hypothesis.
AVERAGE Problem appears to be diagnosed correctly, but there is insufficient data, facts, assumptions, evidence, or incomplete linkage to a theoretical model.
BELOW AVERAGE Incorrect or incomplete definition of the problem (e.g., mistaking symptom for a cause, or selecting minor surface problems which arise from a major problem which is not identified.)

2. PROBLEM ANALYSIS
   
ABOVE AVERAGE ALL critical variables in the case have been identified, and how they interact to create the problem situation in the first place is clearly outlined. Tin essence, the heart of the case.
AVERAGE Only minor variables have been identified while one or more critical variables have been omitted. Identifying the major players but failing to identify the role of each in relation to the variables outlined.
BELOW AVERAGE Neglecting to identify major or minor causative factors and not indicating the origins of these factors. Another issue is the role that the principals in the case played with respect to control of any of the variables.

3. PROBLEM SOLUTION AND SELECTION OF ALTERNATIVES
   
ABOVE AVERAGE Clear evidence that, several alternatives were considered, that specific criteria for selecting the preferred alternatives were generated, and that the recommended alternative is within the manager’s control. Integration of theory into problem solving is the goal.
AVERAGE The alternative selected as the best solution was adequate but not the best solution that could have been applied or the alternatives failed to include one or more possible solutions.
BELOW AVERAGE Only 1 or 2 alternatives were considered, no selection criteria were evident, or the solution is deemed to be beyond the control of the manager or is simply not feasible within existing constraints.

  <li>PRESENTATION</li>
  1. CREATIVITY, ORIGINALITY, DIVERSITY OF METHODS

ABOVE AVERAGE Presentation incorporates a variety of delivery techniques, and supporting materials (including prompts, role-plays, etc.)
AVERAGE Variety of techniques to present materials is used, but little attention paid to generating class interest.
BELOW AVERAGE Only one delivery technique (e.g., reading the case) is used.

2.VERBAL AND NON-VERBAL PRESENTATION SKILLS
ABOVE AVERAGE All presenters can be clearly heard, grammar and syntax are correct, and verbal and non-verbal signals are of a quality nature.
AVERAGE Minor grammatical or syntactical errors as well as some minor disruptions in presentation flow.
BELOW AVERAGE Some presenters in the group cannot be easily heard or engage in distracting mannerisms, confusion of roles and sequencing of materials.

3.PROMPTING AND LEADING THE GROUP DISCUSSION
ABOVE AVERAGE Group leader presents questions to class and facilitates a discussion that includes feedback on the problem identification, analysis and solution.
AVERAGE Superficial questions asked of the group; responses to questions, comments are evasive or incomplete.
BELOW AVERAGE Behaving defensively to group feedback, dismissing validity of participant observations or unable to generate and maintain class discussion to any significant degree.
