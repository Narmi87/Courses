# Course Objectives
Managing People in Organizations is a field of study that investigates the impact that individuals, groups, and structure have on behaviour within an organization. Specifically, this course focuses on how to improve productivity, reduce absenteeism and turnover, and increase employee citizenship and job satisfaction. We all hold generalizations about the behaviour of people. Some of our generalizations may provide valid insights into human behaviour, but many are erroneous. Managing People in Organizations uses systematic study to improve predictions of behaviour that would be made from intuition alone. This course will synthesize many organizational behaviour concepts with the application of several human resource management concepts to yield a fuller picture of this challenge. But, because people are different, we need to look at behaviour in organizations in a contingency framework, using situational variables to moderate cause-effect relationships.

Managing People in Organizations offers both challenges and opportunities for managers. It offers specific insights to improve a manager's people skills. In times of rapid, ongoing, and turbulent change - what most managers face today - Managing People in Organizations can help managers cope in a world of pandemics or temporariness and learn ways to stimulate innovation. Finally, it can offer managers guidance in creating an ethically healthy work climate.

This course is designed to give you an understanding of the attitudes and behaviour of individuals and groups in all types of organizations and as to how organizations, simple or complex, are structured and patterned to achieve their goals. Topics to be covered include job motivation, job satisfaction, job stress, employee selection and succession planning, performance management, workforce diversity, work/life balance, multiple intelligences, workplace behaviour, communication, organizational politics, knowledge management, leadership, group dynamics, decision making, conflict, culture, and change.
This course will strive to help you develop a grasp of what has been referred to as the "rationale of the irrational”.

# Evaluation Details

**Participation – Active learning 10%**

Active Learning: Because this course relies heavily on applications and discussions of materials, 10% of your grade
will be determined from active learning activities. Active learning means that you take responsibility both for your
learning and helping others to learn more about the material. Examples include (but are not limited to)
contributing to class discussion, bringing relevant newspaper and magazine articles to the attention of your
classmates and the instructor. These marks are scaled so that what you might consider “average” participation
results in a mark of about C.

Active learning also means listening to what others say and responding accordingly. Active learning is not coming
to class unprepared and ill-equipped to intelligently discuss the topic of the day. Active learning is also not being a
warm body in the classroom whose mind is pre-occupied with other critical issues such as: how to tackle the next
statistics assignment.

Marks for active learning will be allocated in the following manner:

C: for attending class on a regular basis and only occasionally contributing to the learning experience.

B- to B: for showing an active interest in class activities and participating somewhat in classroom discussions; for
regularly making insightful comments which help others to understand the course material; for being a positive
group member; for otherwise enhancing the learning environment as best as you can considering personality traits
that may hinder.

B+ to A-: for consistently enhancing the quality of discussion in a variety of forms and for near-perfect attendance
(excuses such as a family emergency will be considered legitimate reasons for absence, others are less likely to
qualify) and proving to go above and beyond the call of duty in terms of extra contributions to the classroom
experience (creativity will be rewarded).

A to A+: Students in this category provide leadership in the classroom and work towards enhancing the
interpersonal dynamics of the classroom. This does not mean they dominate the setting; rather they act as
facilitators, bringing others into the discussion and bringing relevant materials to the attention of others.

**Mid-term tests 45%**

You will have 3, 1-hour in-class tests throughout the term, each covering 3-4 OB/HR topics.

Mid-term test 1 will consist of 45 multiple choice questions and will cover the material from weeks 1-2-3:
- What Is Managing People in Organizations?
- Perception, Personality and Emotions.
- Stress at Work

Mid-term test 2 will consist of 3-4 short answer questions and will cover the material from weeks 4-5-6:
- Theories of Motivation
- Motivation in Action
- Groups and Teams

Mid-term test 3 will consist of a single essay addressing the material from weeks 7-8:
- Communications
- Conflict and Negotiation
- Leadership

**Group Project 30% & Group Presentation 15%**

You are responsible for finding a “client” organization able and willing to have you help them solve a problem they
are unable to. You will be required to develop a case study* on the selected organization and its current challenge.

The case study should include:
1) a definition or discussion of a problem, its importance, and managerial implications;
2) a selected review of the literature related to the problem;
3) a summary or conclusion which indicates possible solutions to the problem or extensions or research on the problem. This must be an actual case study of an organization willing /able to agree to participate.

A case is a description of an administrative decision or problem that people are trying to solve (or a record of an issue that
has been faced by the people involved), together with the surrounding circumstances, facts, opinions, and prejudices on
which decisions depended. It is usually written from the point of view of the decision-maker. The focus of a case study can
be on a person and her/his impact, incident, or situation. The case presents actual events that have occurred in an
organization, covering a variety of human aspects of management, to demonstrate the complexity of real-life situations. It
tells how the situation developed and how it was handled up to the decision point.
Each team will be allotted 20 minutes to present the case. The presentation is to include a brief description of the
background and context of the problem situation, identify alternate courses of action, evaluate each and finally
present a recommended solution. There will be a 5-minute question period following your presentation. The entire 
process should take about 25 minutes.

Complete instructions for this project can be found on Moodle.
