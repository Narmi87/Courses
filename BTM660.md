# Course Description
This course introduces the students to the principles and methods of project management. Students
use popular project management software tools, such as Microsoft Project and ProjectLibre to work
on their projects. Topics covered include, among others: project activity planning, risk management,
budgeting, scheduling, resource allocation, and monitoring, with an emphasis on Information
Technology projects.

# Course Overview
**Principles:**

This course simultaneously presents the general principles of project management while addressing
specific examples across a wide range of applications from various disciplines. Students in the class
may come from different departments and faculties. Therefore, the course will deal with project
management concepts in a holistic, integrated fashion whereby students can explore via class
discussion both technical and managerial challenges. Because this course is delivered at the MBA
level, it will stress the strategic advantage of the project management approach.

**Project Management Institute (PMI):**

The course expands into the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) of the project
management institute (PMI) where students will have the opportunity to review the project
management professional (PMP) certification requirements and practice typical PMP questions in an
interactive web-based environment.

**Tools:**

In the course students will also learn to use Microsoft Project and ProjectLibre and use them as part of
the course requirements.

**Pedagogy:**

The course will be focused on the problem-based approach, where students will discuss the project
management principles via a series of problems presented to them, and by bringing cases from their
own experience into the classroom for discussion.

# Learning Outcomes
The main objective of this course is to provide students with a good understanding of project
management concepts and how these concepts can be used to strategically align projects with the
organization’s strategy a design them to meet the goals of the projects. To that effect, the primary
outcomes of the course are:
1. To understand basic project management concepts and explain how they are related.
2. To understand and explain the impact of the various principles of project management on the
organization.
3. To demonstrate their ability to create quality project management documents.

## Formattnig/Structure

**Subdivision - numbered sections**

Divide your article into clearly defined and numbered sections. Subsections should be numbered 1.1
(then 1.1.1, 1.1.2, ...), 1.2, etc. (the abstract is not included in section numbering). Use this numbering
also for internal cross-referencing: do not just refer to 'the text'. Any subsection may be given a brief
heading. Each heading should appear on its own separate line.

**Introduction**

State the objectives of the work and provide an adequate background, avoiding a detailed literature
survey or a summary of the results.

**Appendices**

If there is more than one appendix, they should be identified as A, B, etc. Formulae and equations in
appendices should be given separate numbering: Eq. (A.1), Eq. (A.2), etc.; in a subsequent appendix,
Eq. (B.1) and so on. Similarly for tables and figures: Table A.1; Fig. A.1, etc.

**Figure captions**

Ensure that each illustration has a caption. Supply captions separately, not attached to the figure. A
caption should comprise a brief title (not on the figure itself) and a description of the illustration.
Keep text in the illustrations themselves to a minimum but explain all symbols and abbreviations
used. Place the figure caption below the figure and center both. Eg. Figure 1. Theoretical model for
use satisfaction.

**Tables**

Number tables consecutively in accordance with their appearance in the text. Place footnotes to tables
below the table body and indicate them with superscript lowercase letters. Avoid vertical rules. Be
sparing in the use of tables and ensure that the data presented in tables do not duplicate results
described elsewhere in the article. Place the table caption above the figure and center both. Eg. Table 1. 
Theoretical model for use satisfaction.

**References**

_Citation in text_

Please ensure that every reference cited in the text is also present in the reference list (and vice versa).
Do not make references in the abstract. Unpublished results and personal communications are not
recommended in the reference list, but may be mentioned in the text. If these references are included
in the reference list they should follow the standard reference style of the journal and should include a
substitution of the publication date with either 'Unpublished results' or 'Personal communication'.
Citation of a reference as 'in press' implies that the item has been accepted for publication.

_Web references_

As a minimum, the full URL should be given and the date when the reference was last accessed. Any
further information, if known (DOI, author names, dates, reference to a source publication, etc.),
should also be given. Web references can be listed separately (e.g., after the reference list) under a
different heading if desired, or can be included in the reference list.

_Reference style_

Text: Citations in the text should follow the referencing style used by the American Psychological
Association. You are referred to the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association,
Sixth Edition, ISBN 978-1-4338-0561-5, copies of which may be ordered
from http://books.apa.org/books.cfm?id=4200067 or APA Order Dept., P.O.B. 2710, Hyattsville, MD
20784, USA or APA, 3 Henrietta Street, London, WC3E 8LU, UK.

List: references should be arranged first alphabetically and then further sorted chronologically if
necessary. More than one reference from the same author(s) in the same year must be identified by the
letters 'a', 'b', 'c', etc., placed after the year of publication.
